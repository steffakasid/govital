A command-line tool to scan all dependencies of a given Go project and check if those dependencies are actively maintained and if the used versions are up to date.

== Features

* Scans all dependencies of a Go project
* Checks if dependencies are actively maintained
* Identifies outdated dependency versions
* Provides detailed dependency status report

== Prerequisites

* Go 1.24.5 or later
* Git (for downloading dependencies)

== Installation

=== Homebrew

Install via Homebrew tap:

[source,bash]
----
brew tap steffakasid/homebrew-govital
brew install govital
----

=== Go Install

Install directly using Go:

[source,bash]
----
go install github.com/steffakasid/govital@latest
----

=== From Source

Clone and build:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/steffakasid/govital.git
cd govital
go build -o govital ./cmd/govital
----

== Usage

=== Basic Scan

Scan the current project:

[source,bash]
----
govital scan
----

Scan a specific project:

[source,bash]
----
govital scan --project-path /path/to/project
----

=== Set Stale Threshold

Configure when dependencies are considered inactive (default: 30 days):

[source,bash]
----
govital scan --stale-threshold 180
----

=== Include Indirect Dependencies

By default, only direct dependencies are scanned. To include indirect (transitive) dependencies:

[source,bash]
----
govital scan --include-indirect
----

This is useful for analyzing the full dependency tree but can be slower for large projects.

=== Log Levels

Set log level for output:

[source,bash]
----
govital scan --log-level debug
----

Available levels: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`

=== Configuration

Create a `govital.yaml` in your project root, `~/.govital/`, or `/etc/govital/`:

[source,yaml]
----
log_level: info  # Options: debug, info, warn, error

scanner:
  # Days a dependency can be inactive before marked as stale (default: 365)
  stale_threshold_days: 365

  # Days a dependency must be updated within to be considered active (default: 90)
  active_threshold_days: 90
----

You can also use CLI flags to override config file settings:

[source,bash]
----
# Override stale threshold via CLI
govital scan --stale-threshold 180

# Override log level
govital scan --log-level debug
----

=== Configuration Priority

1. CLI flags (highest priority)
2. Config file (`govital.yaml`)
3. Environment variables (future support)
4. Defaults (lowest priority)
